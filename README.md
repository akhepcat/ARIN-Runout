ARIN-Runout
===========

Quick and crappy code to plot ARIN IPv4 runout trending

Requirements:
	You will need to install the  ggplot2, nlme, splines, and scales libraries into your local R.

Usage:
	Just run the bash script RunRate.sh in the directory that you want the graphs generated.



By default, the ArinRunout.R code will build three different graphs:

  Y2K  to date
  from Epoch
